I'm working on a new version on my portfolio. This is about what I had in 2020, with updates for some newer
projects. My projects live in a different repo now, and will be hosted on a different server.

Obvs, a portfolio site to present history, accomplishments, and projects.

Really, just a simple SPA with dynamic routing, built to later integrate with headless CMS and/or SSR/SSG. It so far runs off of static JSON containing flags to activate different features of various portfolio pieces.

To call out a few things that could fly under the radar... on tablet/touch/landscape, my solution for activating the informational state of the thumbnails (without the hover present on desktop/laptop) in either two or three-column breakpoints. And my swipe feature in the portfolio piece detail view. I also kinda dig the depth that looks like a drawer in the mobile nav menu.

I've started refactoring for TypeScript, but gonna come back to it after frying some bigger fish.

Another todo is that I built this with the intention to make the technical scope tags for each project into filters, so clickable to link out to a portfolio view of items filtered by the tag. Or it may be crazy to have that many portfolio items, but I think originally the idea was that I may want to continously contribute to projects, but only have a subset featured on the home page... Maybe in the next iteration...

Some of the portfolio peices were a major undertaking bringing back to life... MAJOR time sink. And the only way I can think to make that not a problem in the future is just to be keeping up on a portfolio at all times...

That home hero design is going to change any day now, I swear. 🙂

TODO: URGENT: Expiration Date was found broken in Chrome/Mobile. Maybe a CSS fix. Check all of the Haxe games!!!
TODO: Swap out Bootstrap grid for flexbox.

Merely that I feel like I know my audience here, there's no support for IE like I would have in every other project.

Yeah there's more jQuery in this than I would like. Those choices haven't always been up to me.

If anyone out there wants to use this, pleast just ask, and maybe contribute. 😉

Ok, that's all I have to say for now. ✌️

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
