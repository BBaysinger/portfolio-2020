 * items in each row from left to right when scrolling downward (or opposite).
 * That is determined by using math from scroll position.

            <p>
              {/* Leave just "front-end developer" here to avoid sounding repetitious with "interactive". */}
              I am a passionate front-end web programmer with fifteen+ industry
              years in client-side scripting and building fluid interactive
              experiences. Aside from chunks of time coding proprietary and/or
              specialized rich media, I've been manipulating DOM at runtime
              since 2001 upon becoming acquainted with JavaScript. Visual
              effects were everything to me. I started by doing it the hard way
              to learn everything about compatibility. Then, since earning my
              degree in web design in 2005 and landing a spot in a top-tier
              digital advertising agency, I continued to pursue programming, and
              the quality results were as unending as were the prolific projects
              slung my&nbsp;direction.
            </p>

            <p>
              Inventing and learning have been constant, and every deadline has
              been somewhere between unreasonable and insane. I've been the lead
              architect on nearly every project after getting my feet wet in
              anything that was ever new. Through this path I've gained a unique
              view of UX/UI, front-end, and working with ever-changing teams
              and&nbsp;processes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Meticulous perfectionism, adherence to best practices, and
              flexible solutions have always been my strength and preference as
              time permits, but what's brought me fantastic opportunities has
              been my unending passion for breathing life into beautiful
              concepts. I'm humble af and ready to build more great&nbsp;things.
